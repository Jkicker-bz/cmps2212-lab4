# CMPS2212 – Lab 4: Event Delegation

## Overview
This lab demonstrates event delegation, closest(), and matches() 
to build maintainable UI components using a single listener per parent element.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 – Accordion Menu
Uses event delegation on the parent UL and closest() 
to toggle accordion panels.

### Exercise 2 – Live Tag Builder
Dynamically adds tags and removes them using delegation 
and matches() for delete targeting.

### Exercise 3 – Filterable Card Grid
Implements a filter toolbar using one delegated listener 
and toggles card visibility via classList.

### Exercise 4 – Inline Edit List
Uses delegation to handle double-click editing 
with Enter, Escape, and blur controls.
